Hello, and thank you for viewing my website repository!

Vigoro.us is a project that I've been excited about for quite a while. I love working with user interfaces, and my intention for this project was to showcase my attention to detail using my favorite IDE, Microsoft VSCode, as a design template. The color scheme is derived from the VSCode Dark+ theme, with some alterations based off personal preference. I do not monetize this site, nor was it built in a manner intended to infringe on Microsoft or any their products. 

For questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at collinoshaughnessy@gmail.com
